;convert to erg/s.cm^2.sr.Å for 6173 from one HMI pixel... original number is calculated for the sunquake area
center_disc_flux_6173 = ((f/asqk)*((pix_length*cm_per_arcsec)^2))/visiblewidth ;;erg/s.cm^2.sr.Å



;Using the Planck's equation for a blackbody with Teff=5777 K, I get that the solar radiance at 6173 A is:
;2.39348x10^6 erg/s/cm^2/sr/A



;Another solution I can think of is to take the value provided in the Neckel & Labs atlas at disk center at 6173 A: 3.15d6 erg/s/cm^2/sr/A (which is close to the blackbody value)
;and compare this to the disk center intensity of HMI in DNs.
